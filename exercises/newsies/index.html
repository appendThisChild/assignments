            <h4>The Green Bag Killer Strikes Again!</h4>
            <p>A mysterious German "horse ripper" suspected of killing more than 40 horses apparently struck again yesterday. Two mares were killed in the town of Helmstedt, near Hanover, and another two badly injured. Their stomachs had been slit open with a knife.</p>
            <p>The police suspect that it was the work of an equine serial killer who killed 40 horses in a period of a few months in 1999, in the area around Hanover, in <strong>Lower Saxony.</strong></p>
            <p>Lower Saxony police set up a special investigation team and brought in <mark>forensic experts, a vet, and a psychologist</mark> to profile the killer, in the same way as they would with a normal murderer.</p>
            <p>The police said: "We came to the conclusion that all the killings were the work of one man, but we have very little to go on."</p>

            <h1>Behavioral Psychology:<br>What It Is and How to Use It</h1>
            <h4>What is Behavioral Psychology?</h4>
            <p>Let's define behavioral psychology. Behavioral psychology is the study of the connection between our minds and our behavior. Sometimes you will hear behavioral psychology referred to as behaviorism. The researchers and scientists who study behavioral psychology are trying to understand why we behave the way we do and they are concerned with discovering patterns in our actions and behaviors. The hope is that if we can use behavioral psychology to help us predict how humans will behave, we can build better habits as individuals, create better products as companies, and develop better living spaces as communities.</p>
