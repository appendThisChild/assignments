                    <h2>Alycia S.</h2>
                    <p>Every day, ten minutes before I go to sleep I was recommended to take 3 breaths and 1 sigh for lower nerve pain. They were absolutely amazing together, but once I ran out of sighing and stuck solely with Air I had the worst lower abdominal pain, still felt my nerve pain (but it became manageable) and have hot flashes at night, extreme nauseous, muscle pain and trembles. I have been taking Air alone for two weeks and only take it now for sleeping since it makes me nerve pain manageable since I barely sleep with 24/7 shooting pains.</p>

                    <h2>Leo M.</h2>
                    <p>For years Ive been suffering from extreme fatigue back pain and problems that make me feel like doing nothing allday everyday. since Ive been on it I've been fully active and feelings of worth and reasons to live. it's been amazing. I'm just really concerned that if I stop taking it I will experience withdrawals and other symptoms. For years Ive been going to the doctor trying to figure out what's wrong with me and they haven't been able to figure it out. My other doctor proscribed this medicine and its been amazing. Can anybody tell me the long terms effects of taking this? Will it continue to work or does your body get used to it. Thanks for letting me explain my situation.</p>

                    <h2>Kazue A.</h2>
                    <p>I'd tried everything to help with hot flashes, night sweats and insomnia, nothing worked and I couldn't stay on HRT due to breast cancer. Along came Air and it's been a life-saver. I can sleep through the night, my hot flashes and night sweats have been reduced 50% in frequency and severity along with the accompanying sensation of anxiety before a hot flash comes on. The only side effect I've noticed is a slight increase in joint pain but I've mitigated it. I highly recommend it.</p>
